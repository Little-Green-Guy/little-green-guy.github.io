	<h1>How to create an endless WebM</h1><br>
	<p>In short you need to edit the metadata of the webm and change it to 00:00.
	There are probably multiple ways of doing this but the way I found that worked
	for me was to use mkvinfo to find where the duration metadata is stored in the
	hex for the webm then use a hexeditor to change it. This might possibly work
	with other video formats, I haven't tried it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WqNs5r--h8">Original source.</a></p>
	
	<h4>Instructions</h4>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Have your webm file downloaded, a hex editor installed, and mkvinfo (a linux
	cli tool) installed. (you can install this with the <code>mkvtoolnix</code> package
	or similar.</li>
	<li>run <code>mkvinfo -p video.webm | grep "Duration"</code> in the same directory
	as the webm file</li>
	<li>look for the offset at the end of the output (should start with <code>0x</code>,
	for	example <code>0x141</code>)</li>
	<li>open the webm in a hex editor (eg gHex for a gui tool, or hexedit for a
	cli tool)</li>
	<li>move along two bytes (ie move past the <code>44 89</code>)</li>
	<li>overwrite the next 4 bytes with <code>84 3F 80 00</code> (depending on
	your editor, once you're in the right place you should just be able to type
	<code>843F8000</code></li>
	<li>save you changes</li>
	<li>the duration of your file is now set to zero, so depending on your video
	player it will either show 00:00 or the duration will keep counting up until
	it reaches the end of the video file.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	
	<h4>More information</h4>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxHQ7dW6M2s">This video</a> goes
	into more detail including looking at the specification for mp4 and webm files
	and using this to edit the duration (on the mp4 example it includes negative
	and extremely long durations). Although I am struggling to change the duration
	to exact values I want, by playing around with those 4 bytes (<code>84 3F 80 00</code>)
	I have been able to also produce extremely large durations and negative durations.</p>
