	<h1>Hosting a Minecraft server</h1>
	<h3>How to open services to the internet without access to the router</h3><br>
	<h4>Intro</h4>
	<p>For selfhosting a Minecraft server I'd recommend using Linux, maybe on an
	old laptop or something. Alternatively you can use ur pc with windows but it
	will make some hole	punching harder (or I won't be able to help much).</p>
	
	<h4>1. Actual port forwarding</h4>
	<p>This is how real servers do it (really they aren't behind a nat with a
	firewall so everything's forwarded for them). Its better, but is also a
	security risk for a home network. How secure port forwarding is depends on
	how secure what you are forwarding to is. Forwarding directly to Minecraft
	might not be the best idea, as I don't trust Microsoft to be 100% on top of
	possible holes in mc. Idk, it might be fine.<br>
	Forwarding to a VPN like open VPN, and then connecting to the server from
	the VPN would be better. Comes with its own risks - unless you do clever set
	up, whoever you allow access to your VPN can access your local network.
	Essentially they would be able to hack into your devices more easily because
	you've invited them in. They will also be able to see files on nas
	drives/windows shares if they aren't set up with passwords etc. They can
	also use your internet for bad stuff like hacking or piracy and it will look
	like it is you not them. You can block access to the wider internet more
	easily to stop this tho iirc. If you go this route you can set openvpn on an
	underpowered Linux machine like a raspberry pi. Idk how to do it on windows.
	Also bear in mind that if you use a pi or other debain based operating
	systems these are designed with long term security and stability in mind,
	windows is not. So port forwarding to a VPN on a Linux box will be more
	secure than windows or direct Minecraft.</p>
	
	<h4>2. Hole punching</h4>
	<p>The main problem with port forwarding is setting it up - you need admin
	access to your router. If you don't have this then we can work around this
	using hole punching. This is when you talk to an external server and you use
	them as a kindof proxy - so because you started talking to them first your
	router allows it, and the server port forwards from them to you.<br>
	Hole punching options include:<br>
	Serveo.net, ngrok, commercial vpn, or hamachi, etc</p>
	
	<h4>2.1 serveo.net/ngrok</h4>
	<p>serveo.net and ngrok both use SSH tunneling for hole punching, so I will
	cover them together.<br>
	I recommend serveo.net. its free, and easy (on Linux). You can probably use
	PuTTY to do it on windows but idk how. Instructions for Linux on
	<a href="https://serveo.net">https://serveo.net</a> (just change the ports
	to 25565)<br>
	Ngrok is easier for noobs as it has a client which you have to use, which is
	probably also available for windows, but only allows one port forward
	(serveo is probs unlimited), but that's probably enough for you.<br>
	The downside of these is that the connections are temporary - you might lose
	connection randomly (eg random spike in latency due to WiFi - Ethernet will
	probably help). Every time you lose connection you will probably get a new
	forwarding address. This is a pain for others connecting to your server, but
	has slightly added security (maybe). Its also more secure if you keep half
	an eye on incoming connections (easy with serveo/ngrok), and spot a new IP
	when a new friend hasnt connected, you can quickly shut everything down
	quickly. You could also run serveo on a low powered Linux box and forward it
	to your computer which will be easier than trying to use putty.<br>
	You can use these to either forward directly to Minecraft, or a VPN for
	added security.</p>
	
	<h4>2.2 Commercial VPNs</h4>
	<p>You can also use a paid VPN provider. Rather than tunneling people into
	your network, this is just where you tunnel your connection to an external
	server, and then they will act as a router and do some port forwarding for
	you. Beware not all vpns support this, and it may cost quite a bit. Also
	whenever you disconnect your VPN and reconnect you will probably get a new
	IP and port. You will probably need to change Minecraft to use this port.</p>
	
	<h4>2.3 Hamachi</h4>
	<p>Finally there is hamachi. I haven't used this, I don't know exactly how
	it works, but it looks like a front end and probably does something similar
	to the other methods described here. It may be easier, but also limiting
	(paying for more than 5 people). Imo, hamachi sucks :p</p>
	
	<h4>2.3 2: electric boogaloo. A deeper dive into how Hamachi works, and how to replicate  and self-host thisyourself</h4>
	<p>From what I can tell hamachi uses two techniques: a VPN and UDP hole punching.</p>
	
	<h4>2.3.2 UDP hole punching</h4>
	<p>UDP hole punching is really cool, it uses an external server to set up a
	connection, but then allows each 'peer' to talk to each other directly. It
	also shows that when I was talking about hole punching in my previous
	message I was actually getting my terminology mixed up.</p>

	<h4>2.3.3 VPN - but a different way</h4>
	<p>The other method is a VPN. This is when you connect to an external
	hamachi VPN server, just like you would to nordvpn/express VPN, etc. However
	there is a difference in how the VPN is configured. Normal vpns only allow
	you to talk to the outside internet, whereas the hamachi VPN allows you to
	talk to other 'peers' connecting to it, creating a 'virtual lan' or 'virtual
	local network' of sorts. This is probably more secure than the other methods
	I described, but if you do good configuration of one of my methods, this
	method won't be more secure by much/at all.<br>
	Its more secure than hole punching with serveo/ngrok directly to Minecraft
	because you need a VPN connected with password authentication to join.
	However if you port forward/hole punch a local openvpn server, then that
	server is more secure because you are using certificates not passwords.
	However whoever you give the certificate to can access all of your local
	network.<br>
	1. If you 100% trust who you give the cert to then boom a local openvpn is
	more secure than hamachi<br>
	But we can do better<br>
	2. You can probably change openvpn to only allow connections to your
	Minecraft server, or at least only the computer that hosts the Minecraft
	server. Now you are in theory more secure than hamachi because they can only
	access your computer (like hamachi) and they also need a cert (not just
	password). However, idk how to do this and I'm not entirely sure its
	possible.<br>
	3. You connect the computer running your Minecraft server to the local VPN
	you made (you can do this even of they're on the same computer), and then
	allow your friends to connect, and have the openvpn server set up to only
	allow communication between the virtual lan. This is the same as how the
	hamachi server is set up, except its in your local network, and it requires
	a cert, not password, so its more secure than hamachi.<br>
	Note:<br>
	All this 'more secure' is assuming that the VPN software is super secure and
	the only way of comprising it is to have the password/have the certificate.
	Of course this is not true, but VPN software is pretty secure and its one of
	the better options to have port forwarded to the wider internet.</p>
