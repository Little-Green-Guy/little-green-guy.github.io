	<h1>Chromebooks, and fun with them</h1>
	<h3>In the context of a school issued Chromebook</h3><br>
	<h4>Intro</h4>
	<p>I think Chromebooks are kinda good because you can get a useable experience
	on very cheap hardware. Sure you can't do much but nowadays a lot of people
	spend 90% of their time in the browser. The problem is that other 10%.
	Chromebooks are slowly filling that with android and Linux apps. I was able
	to do coding and shit with atom and python in the linux container. Some
	apps still don't work great/at all tho</p>
	
	<h4>Doing more with Chromebooks</h4>
	<p>As to 'hacking' them. You may not need to, Linux apps may be enough for you
	and the school may not have locked them down. You can also dualboot
	Chromebooks, or boot from USB sticks, but only if you've installed a custom
	BIOS, which you need to enable developer mode for. Idk if the school can
	stop u from doing that in software, if they can they probably will have, and
	its very obvious that you've enabled developer mode if you do (big warning
	screen when you boot it with instructions on how to wipe it and return it to
	normal). You might be able to disbale this if you disable write protection,
	which you do by removing a screw on the motherboard.</p>

	<p>Now onto what distro to run. A lot of drivers for your Chromebook are
	probably missing from Linux. Gallium OS is likely to have better support for
	your Chromebook. I hated xfce that came with gallium and xfce+gnome took up
	too much space on the emmc storage. I eventually got mint working fairly
	well with the gallium os kernel. Its also possible that some Chromebook
	drivers are being ported to mainline so using the latest mainline kernel
	rather than mints may help too. I know some people also had success with
	arch, idk if this is because they had more control, or the latest mainline,
	or a kernel with the drivers, but idk.</p>

	<p>This all also depends on your model of Chromebook. Mr Chromeboxes website is
	good to check, as well as the gallium os wiki. There are also some good
	subreddits, like r/chrultrabook iirc.</p>
